##Unit testing code with the Jest library

###Assignment:

1. You are going to use these concepts to build a JavaScript application that fulfills the following      requirements. Check out all of the possible uses of the expect function to meet the requirements.

2. You are going to work on a simple test scenario.

3. Write a test suite to validate your JavaScript functions.

8. There should be a function defined with the name verifyAlphaNumeric.

9. That function should return false if there are any non-alphanumeric characters in a string.

10. Now that the test suite exists, write a simple application to implement the functionality.

11. In an HTML file, have two elements: a textarea and a button.

12. When the button is clicked, extract the contents of the textarea and validate it against the           following rules.
