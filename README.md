Write a test suite to validate your JavaScript functions.

There should be a function defined with the name checkWordCount.
That function should return false if a string sent to it has more than 100 words in it.
There should be a function defined with the name duplicateCheck.
That function should return false if a string has duplicate words in it.
There should be a function defined with the name verifyAlphaNumeric.
That function should return false if there are any non-alphanumeric characters in a string.
Now that the test suite exists, write a simple application to implement the functionality.

In an HTML file, have two elements: a textarea and a button.
When the button is clicked, extract the contents of the textarea and validate it against the following rules.
There should only be alphanumeric characters in the text. No special characters like $%^&*.  

No duplicate words allowed.
Word count should be less than 100.# jest
